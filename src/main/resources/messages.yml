# Welcome to the ElementalEconomy messages.yml file. This is the file to configure every single chat message that
# the plugin will send to players. Note that all chat messages allow you to specify multiple lines and also color
# codes of course :)
#
# We highly recommend you send your edits through a YAML Parser. Beginner server owners are likely to make mistakes
# whilst editing YAML files such as using the incorrect indentation, formatting, values, apostrophes, and so on.
#
# Happy configuring!

# TODO Work in progress.

# Do not touch this unless you know what you're doing!
