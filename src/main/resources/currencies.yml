# Welcome to the ElementalEconomy messages.yml file. This is the file to edit any currencies you desire your server
# to have. :)
#
# We highly recommend you send your edits through a YAML Parser. Beginner server owners are likely to make mistakes
# whilst editing YAML files such as using the incorrect indentation, formatting, values, apostrophes, and so on.
#
# Happy configuring!

# The default currency used by EE's own commands such as /pay and /baltop.

# The currency used by external plugins such as Vault and thus ChestShop, Jobs, etc (since they use Vault).
# Vault does not have multi-currency support so one must be chosen.
