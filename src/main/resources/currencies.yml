# Welcome to the ElementalEconomy messages.yml file. This is the file to edit any currencies you desire your server
# to have. :)
#
# We highly recommend you send your edits through a YAML Parser. Beginner server owners are likely to make mistakes
# whilst editing YAML files such as using the incorrect indentation, formatting, values, apostrophes, and so on.
#
# Happy configuring!

# The default currency used by EE's own commands such as /pay and /baltop.
default-currency: dollars

# The currency used by external plugins such as Vault and thus ChestShop, Jobs, etc (since they use Vault).
# Vault does not have multi-currency support so one must be chosen.
external-currency: dollars

currencies:

  # The ideal currency for most servers - dollars!
  dollars:

    # This id will be used by the storage system. Do not change it once it is set or all balances will change to whatever is stored on that id.
    # By default, this is 1. Ensure this does not conflict with any other currencies, else they will share the same balances!
    id: 1

    # How much of this currency should be given to players when they first discover it?
    # By default, this is 50.00.
    starting-balance: 50.00

    # ** Only advanced users should mess with this setting! **
    # First step of formatting the balance.
    # Use regular a regular 'DecimalFormat' pattern from Java.
    # By default, this is '###,##0.00'
    decimal-format: '###,##0.00'

    # This is how balances will appear to players.
    # By default, it adds a '$' symbol as a prefix to the balance - '$%decimalFormat%'
    display-format: '$%decimalFormat%'

    # ** Only advanced users should mess with this setting! **
    # How precise should EE store balances of this currency?
    # Otherwise, I *highly* recommend you do not truncate any less than 2 digits.
    # Anything more than 4 is unnecessary and will (very slightly) increase storage usage.
    # This also limits the precision of '/pay', etc.
    # EE's truncation will round down any extra digits, THEN process the transaction.
    # By default, this is 2 digits.
    truncate-digits: 2

    # Psst: you can use a word-format here if you wish. See the 'tokens' example for more info. :)

  # Here is another example currency. You can delete it if you wish.
  tokens:

    # Notice, this uses a different id than 'dollars'. Otherwise they would have the same balances, which would be.. weird (and pointless).
    id: 2

    # 0 tokens to start out with. This is so nobody has any Tokens whilst you test/configure the
    # plugin, so the next currency to use id '2' does not have any old balances stored in it.
    starting-balance: 0

    # This example shows no decimals.
    decimal-format: '###,##0'

    # This example uses %wordFormat%, defined below. Also notice there is no symbol.
    display-format: '%decimalFormat% %wordFormat%'

    # Since this currency only works with integer-balances, it is okay to truncate all decimals (i.e. 0 decimal digits)
    truncate-digits: 0

    # Word format! Notice that 'dollars' didn't include word-format, as it is completely optional to include&/or use this.
    word-format:

      # When the amount is exactly 1 (i.e. 1 Token), this will be the word used.
      singular: 'Token'

      # Otherwise of the above, this will be the word used.
      plural: 'Tokens'

# Do not touch this unless you know what you're doing!
