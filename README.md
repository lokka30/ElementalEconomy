## What is it?
It's an economy provider plugin, which is essentially a plugin that stores and manages virtual balances of players on your server. Other plugins can tell it 'hey, give $5 of in-game currency to this player', 'remove $23.50 from lokka30's balance' or ask 'what's Notch's balance?', for example, but in Java talk of course.

Usually, this plugin is accessed by other plugins using Vault. Vault acts like an interface to access economy provider plugins on the server, like ElementalEconomy, without having to add individual support for each new economy plugin out there. Vault is not required if your installed plugins are accessing ElementalEconomy directly.

ElementalEconomy is a plugin designed from the ground up to simply do what most servers have been asking *years* ago - unfortunately, nobody delivered a solid enough solution, so I took it upon myself to try fill this gap (as I was one of these owners).
