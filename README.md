## What is it?
Economy provider - a central plugin for other plugins to say 'hey, give $5 of in-game currency to this player', or ask 'what's Notch's balance?', but in Java talk of course. Usually, this plugin is accessed by other plugins using Vault, which acts essentially as an interface. Vault is not required if your installed plugins are accessing ElementalEconomy directly.

ElementalEconomy is a plugin designed from the ground up to simply do what most servers have been asking *years* ago - unfortunately, nobody delivered, so I took it upon myself to try fill this gap (as I was one of these owners).
